# Anti-Corruption Detection App

This is a **React application** built with JavaScript to detect and analyze potential corruption scenarios using a fuzzy decision-making model. The app processes several attributes to assess corruption likelihood, providing a systematic and data-driven approach to decision-making.

## Features

- **Fuzzy Decision-Making Model**: Implements logic for assessing corruption probability based on fuzzy logic principles.
- **Core Attributes**:
  - **`rank`**: The rank or position of the individual being evaluated.
  - **`salary`**: The official salary of the individual.
  - **`bribeSize`**: The size of any reported bribes.
  - **`companyTransparencyLevel`**: A measure of the company's transparency.
  - **`companyCorruptionLevel`**: The perceived level of corruption in the company.
  - **`faith`**: A subjective measure of trust or belief in the individual.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (JS/JSX)
- **Logic**: Fuzzy decision-making model implemented in JavaScript
- **State Management**: React class component for managing dynamic state changes
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Create React App (specify if needed)
